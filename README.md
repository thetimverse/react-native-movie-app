# Movie App in React Native

## Install
Clone or download zip then
`npm install`
To start the server on Expo
`npx expo start`

## Current issues 
- AllMoviesScreen (needs to show a flatlist of all movies (either upcoming or top rated)) doesn't work, I don't understand renderItem (*line 22*)
- FavoriteScreen with AsyncStorage and AllShows (AllMovies but with shows) not done yet
